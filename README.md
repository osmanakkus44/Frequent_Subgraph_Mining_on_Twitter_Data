# <div align = center>Frequents Subgraph Mining on Twitter Data</div>

**gSpan** is an algorithm for mining frequent subgraphs.

This program project uses gspan algorithm and uses following repository. The repository on GitHub is [https://github.com/betterenvi/gSpan](https://github.com/betterenvi/gSpan).

### Summary
This is one of my undergraduate thesis project. In this project we have set of Twitter
data gathered via Twitter API. I used two different Twitter data, converted all data
to a graph model and then retrieved all interested subgraphs with GSPAN algorithm
which is one of the best graph based frequent subgraph mining methods. This method
applied based on the date range of the tweets to determine what kinda tweets have
been written in a time range and then plotted a chart to represent them on this range.

### Run
All you need is a jupyter notebook.You run ```bitirme.ipynb```. I will add dataset soon. Till that you can run it via existing data converted and saved data in ```graphdata.txt```.
